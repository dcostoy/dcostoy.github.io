<h2>I'm a NY-based agile UX designer, service designer, and strategist with experience in education technology and telecommunications.</h2>

I’ve served on scrum teams as well as overseen strategic projects, providing low- and high-fidelity UI design as well as performing targeted qualitative and quantitative studies, primarily in education technology and telecommunications.

I’m seeking a full-time remote or New York-based position at a medium or large service-oriented company with an appetite for learning.
